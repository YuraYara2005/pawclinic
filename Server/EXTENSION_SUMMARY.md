## 📝 MODIFIED FILES (Minimal Changes)

### 1. `middleware/validationMiddleware.js`
**What changed:**

## 🎯 NEW ENDPOINTS

### Owners Module (5 endpoints)
```
GET    /api/owners          - Get all owners
GET    /api/owners/:id      - Get single owner
POST   /api/owners          - Create owner (requires: name, phone)
PUT    /api/owners/:id      - Update owner
DELETE /api/owners/:id      - Delete owner (blocked if has pets)
```

### Pets Module (5 endpoints)
```
GET    /api/pets            - Get all pets (with owner info)
GET    /api/pets/:id        - Get single pet (with owner details)
POST   /api/pets            - Create pet (validates owner exists)
PUT    /api/pets/:id        - Update pet (validates new owner exists)
DELETE /api/pets/:id        - Delete pet
```

**Total: 10 new endpoints**

---

## 🔒 SECURITY & VALIDATION

### Authentication
All endpoints require JWT authentication (same as existing endpoints).

### Validation Rules

**Owners:**
- `name` - Required, 2-100 characters
- `phone` - Required, max 20 characters  
- `email` - Optional, must be valid email
- `address` - Optional, max 500 characters

**Pets:**
- `name` - Required, 1-100 characters
- `owner_id` - Required, must exist in database
- `species` - Required, max 50 characters
- `breed` - Optional, max 100 characters
- `age` - Optional, integer 0-100
- `weight` - Optional, non-negative float

### Business Logic
1. **Owner Deletion** - Prevented if owner has pets
2. **Pet Creation/Update** - Owner must exist before operation

---

## 🏗️ CODE PATTERNS FOLLOWED

### ✅ Exact Match to Existing Code

1. **Controller Structure**
   - Uses `asyncHandler` wrapper
   - Uses parameterized queries only
   - Same error throwing pattern
   - Returns data in same format

2. **Route Structure**
   - Same middleware chaining
   - Same documentation comments
   - Consistent with existing routes

3. **Response Format**
   ```javascript
   // Success
   { "success": true, "data": {...} }
   
   // Error
   { "success": false, "message": "..." }
   ```

4. **Database Queries**
   - All use `pool.query()` with `?` placeholders
   - No string concatenation
   - Same JOIN pattern for related data

---

## 📊 DATABASE INTEGRATION

### Existing Tables Used
- `owners` - Already in your schema
- `pets` - Already in your schema

### Relationships
```
owners (1) ----< (many) pets ----< (many) appointments
```

The new modules complete the data model:
- Owners can have multiple pets
- Pets belong to one owner
- Appointments reference both pets and owners

---

## 🧪 TESTING

### Automated Test Script
```bash
chmod +x tests/test-owners-pets.sh
./tests/test-owners-pets.sh
```

**Tests included:**
- Authentication
- Get all owners/pets
- Get single owner/pet
- Create owner/pet
- Update owner/pet
- Delete owner/pet
- Validation errors
- Business rule validation
- Non-existent resource handling

### Manual Testing Examples

**Create Owner:**
```bash
curl -X POST `${import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL}/api/owners \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "phone": "555-1234",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "address": "123 Main St"
  }'
```

**Create Pet:**
```bash
curl -X POST `${import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL}/api/pets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "owner_id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffy",
    "species": "Cat",
    "breed": "Persian",
    "age": 3,
    "weight": 4.5
  }'
```

---

## 🔄 INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING MODULES

### Appointments Integration
Your existing `appointmentController.js` already includes:
```sql
LEFT JOIN pets p ON a.pet_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN owners o ON a.owner_id = o.id
```

Now that Owners and Pets modules are complete:
- ✅ All foreign keys validated
- ✅ Complete referential integrity
- ✅ Full data model implemented

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before using in production:

- [ ] Run `npm install` (no new dependencies needed)
- [ ] Verify database has owners and pets tables
- [ ] Start server: `npm start`
- [ ] Check startup message shows new routes
- [ ] Run test script: `./tests/test-owners-pets.sh`
- [ ] Test with Postman/cURL
- [ ] Verify authentication required
- [ ] Test validation errors
- [ ] Test business rules (owner deletion with pets)

---

## 🚀 QUICK START

### 1. Database Already Set Up
Your schema already includes owners and pets tables with sample data.

### 2. Start Server
```bash
npm start
```

Expected output includes:
```
Available Routes:
  ...existing routes...
  GET    /api/owners
  POST   /api/owners
  PUT    /api/owners/:id
  DELETE /api/owners/:id
  GET    /api/pets
  POST   /api/pets
  PUT    /api/pets/:id
  DELETE /api/pets/:id
```

### 3. Get Token
```bash
curl -X POST `${import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL}/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@pawclinic.com","password":"admin123"}'
```

### 4. Test New Endpoints
```bash
# Get all owners
curl `${import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL}/api/owners \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Get all pets
curl `${import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL}/api/pets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```
